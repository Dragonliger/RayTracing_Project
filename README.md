## Introduction
The challenge was to build a functioning raytracing renderer in C++ following <a href="https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html">this book's instructions</a>, adding new features and modifying it as required. 

The program introduces many important concepts that modern renderers have, like setting up a camera, primitives, diffuse shading and materials.
